## Development State: 

Kite is currently in **feature-freeze** for the 1.0 release, so which branch you target matters:

- **Bugfixes for 1.0** → pull request against **`master`**, the release line.
- **New features or functional changes** → pull request against **`development`**, the integration
  trunk. They are welcome there now, but will not reach `master` until after the final 1.0 release.

Nobody commits to either branch directly — see
**[Contributing](https://b14ckyy.github.io/Kite-GC/for-developers/contributing/)** for the full
branching model.

**Kite Ground Control (Kite GC)** is a modern, cross-platform ground control station for **INAV**,
**ArduPilot** and **PX4** aircraft — planes, multirotors, VTOL, helicopters, rovers and boats. It
combines everything you expect from a GCS with a fast, intuitive interface and a few things you won't
find anywhere else — like a full 3D flight view, a fleet & battery manager, and live video right next
to the map.

Built with [Tauri 2.0](https://tauri.app/) (Rust backend) and [Svelte 5](https://svelte.dev/)
(TypeScript frontend).

## Highlights

- **🧊 Immersive 3D flight view** — a full 3D globe with real terrain, your aircraft and track in 3D, a
  3D mission overlay, an FPV cockpit camera and real-time day/night lighting; switch 2D ⇄ 3D seamlessly.
- **🚁 One GCS for INAV, ArduPilot & PX4** — plan, fly and log across all three autopilots with a
  consistent interface, including passive (listen-only) and relay link modes.
- **🏭 Fleet, Battery & Mission managers** — keep a library of your aircraft and batteries with full
  build sheets and lifetime stats, plus a reusable mission library — all linked to your flight log.
- **⚡ Fast & intuitive** — a performance-oriented interface with dockable widgets and panels that
  remembers your layout, so the focus stays on flying.

## The essentials

Everything you'd expect from a ground station:

- **Live telemetry & HUD** — attitude, altitude, speed (incl. airspeed), a compass with wind and
  ground-track indicators, GPS/sensor health, link quality and flight-mode display.
- **Customisable widget dashboard** — drag-and-drop flight widgets docked to the side and bottom.
- **2D moving map** — aircraft, track, home and mission, with heading-up mode and day/night shading.
- **Mission planning** — create, upload, download and edit missions; undo/redo; a survey-pattern
  generator; terrain-following / AGL waypoints.
- **Vehicle control** — arm/disarm, flight-mode changes, takeoff/RTL/loiter and more (ArduPilot/PX4).
- **Comfort** — a multi-language interface (English, German, French at launch) with persistent window,
  layout and settings between sessions.

## What makes Kite special

- **Full 3D mode** — Cesium 3D globe with real terrain, a unified 3D mission overlay, an FPV cockpit
  camera with a conformal HUD, and live day/night lighting.
- **Terrain awareness** — AGL (above-ground) waypoints, a terrain-profile analysis for your mission,
  and live *terrain radar* / AGL widgets in flight.
- **Flight Logbook** — automatic recording with replay, plus import of INAV blackbox, **ArduPilot
  Dataflash**, MAVLink `.tlog` and **MWPTools-compatible raw-MSP** logs — unified into one searchable
  flight history.
- **Fleet (Vehicle) Manager** — a build sheet per aircraft (airframe, propulsion, FC, sensors, photo)
  with lifetime statistics, auto-linked to your flights; export/import as `.kvehicle`.
- **Battery Manager** — track each pack by serial: cycles, lifetime usage and health, with `.kbatt`
  export/import.
- **Safety suite** — geofences (ArduPilot/PX4), geozones (INAV), safe-home & fixed-wing autoland,
  airspace overlays (airports, controlled airspace, obstacles) and **foreign-vehicle radar** with
  ADS-B proximity & conflict alerts.
- **Live video** — a local capture device (webcam / USB capture card) or a low-latency RTSP stream,
  shown alongside (or behind) the map, with one-click map ⇄ video swapping.
- **Telemetry relay** — re-encode and forward live telemetry to other ground stations, handsets or an
  antenna tracker.
- **RC control** — fly from the GCS with a gamepad/joystick (HID).
- **RF link analysis** — visualise signal quality to find the best antenna setup.

## Supported setups

- **Autopilots:** INAV (7.0+), ArduPilot, PX4.
- **Aircraft:** fixed-wing, flying-wing, VTOL, multirotor, helicopter, rover, boat.
- **Connections:** USB / serial, Bluetooth (SPP & BLE), TCP, UDP.
- **Link modes:** live control link, **passive** listen-only telemetry, or a **relay** that
  re-broadcasts to other ground stations.
- **Platforms:** Windows, macOS (universal, unsigned) and Linux (x86-64 / ARM64). Android and iOS are
  in development for a release after 1.0.
